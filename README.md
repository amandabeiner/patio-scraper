# Patio Scraper

My coworker decided to build a React App to check off which patios he's visited of "Boston's best Patios". I decided to build a web scraper so that the patios wouldn't have to be inputted manually! This web scraper parses the url given to it using `HTTParty` and `Nokogiri`.

## Setup
To get set up, run the following:
```no-highlight
  bundle
  ruby webscraper.rb
```

The results will be outputted to the `padios.csv' file.
